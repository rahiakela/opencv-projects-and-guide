        "With the development of computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning, face recognition has become a hot topic. **Face recognition can be applied to a wide range of uses, including crime prevention, surveillance, forensic applications, biometrics, and, more recently, in social networks.** Automatic face recognition has various challenges, such as occlusions, appearance variations, expression, aging, and scale variations. Following its success with object recognition, CNNs have been widely used for face recognition.\r\n",
